# Feature Request: User Export

## Problem

Users need to export their data for backup or migration purposes. Currently there's no way to get data out of the system.

## Solution

Add a data export feature that allows users to download their data in common formats (JSON, CSV).

## Success Criteria

- Users can export their profile data
- Users can export their activity history
- Exports available in JSON and CSV formats
- Export completes within 30 seconds for typical accounts

## Out of Scope

- Importing data (future feature)
- Exporting other users' data
- Scheduled/automated exports
