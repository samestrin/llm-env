# Technical Debt Management Workflow

## Decision

Technical debt is proactively managed through **adversarial code reviews** performed after each "GREEN" (passing tests) TDD phase. Detected issues are classified by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and routed based on effort estimation:

1.  **Small Issues (< 1 week effort):** Automatically fixed inline immediately during the review phase.
2.  **Failed Fixes & Large Items (1+ week effort):**
    *   **Quick-wins & General Backlog:** Logged directly into `technical-debt/README.md` for visibility.
    *   **Sprint-sized Initiatives:** Documented in dedicated files following the pattern `technical-debt/active/td-##-description.md`.

## Rationale

*   **Single Source of Truth:** Centralizes debt tracking to prevent items from being lost in chat logs or forgotten comments.
*   **Proactive Quality:** Integrating "adversarial" reviews into the standard workflow ensures debt is caught when context is fresh, rather than accumulating silently.
*   **Automated Hygiene:** Encourages immediate resolution of minor issues, preventing "death by a thousand cuts."

## Applies When

*   Completing the "Green" phase of a TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor).
*   Finalizing feature implementation before merging.
*   Conducting architectural reviews or self-correction loops.
