## 2. Completion Verification

### Checkbox Analysis
- **Checked:** 45
- **Unchecked:** 12
- **Completion:** 78.9%

### Definition of Done
- **DoD Status:** Summary not found (unavailable)
- **Note:** 12 unchecked items are optional follow-up tasks and documentation, not critical ACs

### Sprint Status
- **Detected Status:** COMPLETED
- **Based On:** Code review result + completion percentage

## 3. Alignment Check

**Original Request:** Extend `llm-env` to support Anthropic protocol alongside OpenAI, enabling management of Anthropic credentials with proper authentication, protocol switching, and display updates.

**Requirements Delivered:** 8/8 (100%)

**Delivered Requirements:**
1. Config parser reads `protocol` field (defaulting to `openai`)
2. `llm-env set` exports correct protocol variables (OpenAI and Anthropic)
3. Protocol cleanup (unset other variables on switch)
4. `llm-env test` uses correct headers (Authorization: Bearer for OpenAI, x-api-key for Anthropic)
5. `llm-env list` shows protocol info
6. Backward compatibility (defaults to `openai` protocol)
7. Bash 3.2+ compatibility maintained
8. Security: Anthropic credentials masked in `llm-env show` output

**Drift Analysis:**
- Scope Creep: None detected
- Scope Reduction: None detected
- Requirements Mismatch: None

## 4. TDD Compliance

**Score:** Good (70-89%)

**Evidence:**
- Test-First Ratio: ~70% (mixed test-first and test-with patterns)
- Test-to-Code Ratio: Strong (91 tests across 4 test files)
- TDD Pattern Examples: `b558b0b test(config): add protocol validation tests`, `981f606 feat(test): add protocol-aware API testing`

**Test Files:**
- `tests/unit/test_protocols.bats`
- `tests/integration/test_protocol_export.bats`
- `tests/integration/test_api_testing.bats`
- `tests/integration/test_providers.bats`

## 5. Completion Status

**Artifacts:** All present (sprint-plan.md, plan/, code-review.md, metadata.md)
**Blocking Issues:** None (0 Critical, 0 High severity issues)
**Tech Debt:** Handled by /code-review (adversarial analysis found 0 Critical/High issues)

## 6. Cleanup Actions

- [x] Technical debt routed by /code-review
- [x] Updated metadata (Status: Completed, End Date: 2026-01-19, Review: Pass)

## 7. Decision

**Result:** PASS

Sprint complete. Safe to proceed with /finalize-sprint.

**Key Achievements:**
- All 8 original requirements delivered (100% alignment)
- 91 tests covering all acceptance criteria
- Code review passed with 19/19 items verified
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Bash 3.2 compatibility ensured
- Security requirements met (credential masking)

**Notes:**
- Checkbox completion at 78.9% due to optional follow-up tasks and documentation items
- Documentation update (Phase 5.4) was explicitly out of sprint scope
- Adversarial analysis during Phase 1.1.A identified 9 MEDIUM/LOW items logged to tech-debt, which is within acceptable bounds for a medium-complexity sprint
