# Simple Test Results

Based on testing, the core issues are:

1. **PowerShell Classes**: The LLMProvider and LLMConfiguration classes from DataModels.ps1 are not available when modules try to use them
2. **Module Import Failures**: Several modules have syntax errors preventing proper import
3. **Function Export Issues**: Library functions are not being properly exported to cmdlets

## Working Components
- Individual components work when loaded in isolation
- Classes work when DataModels.ps1 is dot-sourced first  
- Configuration loading works when dependencies are loaded in correct order

## Recommendation
This is a complex architectural issue that would be better addressed by:
1. Creating a simpler module structure
2. Using nested modules or a different loading strategy
3. Ensuring PowerShell classes are available globally

The current approach of trying to fix the existing structure may require more time than creating a cleaner implementation from scratch.
